# fbp-diffbot

Automatically posts diffs for FBP graph changes on Github PRs,
using [fbp-diff](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-diff).

## Status

**Prototyping**. Nothing works yet

## TODO

### v0.1 "minimally useful"

* Getting the changed graphs from a pull request
* Produce the actuall FBP diffs
* Posting the diff back to PR
* Register webhooks for automatic update from Github
* Deploy it to production

### Later

* Support visual diffs
